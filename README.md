In this last assignment I created a website showcasing an imaginary floral buissness. I made 3 HTML pages that are linked together by buttons. Each page is slightly different, the first one has information about the bussiness with linked product pages. The second is an about us page with an image and the last is a contact form to send in questions to the buissiness. I also used simple javascript code to say a message everytime the page is refreshed, using the help of W3schools. (it can be annoying but I still wanted to make use of javscript in some way without being too complicated)
